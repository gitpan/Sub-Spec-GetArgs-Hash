NAME
    Sub::Spec::GetArgs::Hash - Get subroutine arguments %args from hash
    (%args) :)

VERSION
    version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
     # nothing to see here

DESCRIPTION
    This is an empty distribution. Created just as a reminder that you don't
    need to do anything if you already have a hash. Sub::Spec-following
    subroutines already accepts hash as arguments by default. (You'd think
    that this reminder is unnecessary, but I've known to think stranger
    things and forget even simpler facts :))

    Each argument in the args clause can specify aliases (using the
    "arg_aliases" clause), example:

     $SPEC{myfunc} = {
         ...
         args => {
             check_content => [bool => {
                 ...
                 arg_aliases => {
                    cc => {},
                 },
             }],
             ...
        },
     };

    But note that these aliases are meant only for command-line
    applications, parsed by Sub::Spec::GetArgs::Argv. So this is valid (in
    command-line):

     % script.pl --cc

    but this is not recognized (in Perl):

     my $res = myfunc(cc => 1); # only myfunc(check_content => 1) is recognized
